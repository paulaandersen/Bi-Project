The entity data block is submitted to the cluster for voting, where each node has an associated class of service. Votes received are weighted based on a relationship between the entity data block class of service and the verification node class of service to obtain a weighted vote. A verification score is calculated based on the weighted votes and checked against a verification threshold. If the verification score exceeds the verification threshold, the entity data block is verified on the blockchain. Also, a cluster can use weighted voting to accept a new node where votes are weighted based on a relationship between the new node's class of service and a voting node's class of service. ;US;Jersey;A;US;USA

Users would send their transaction to the cubesats which would collect them into blocks, sign them, and send (bounce) them back to earth (and to one another). Bounce Blockchain provides scalability through sharding (transactions will be partitioned over cubesats). Because modern hardware security modules are tamper-resistant (become inoperable if tampered with) or tamper-responsive (erase their keys if tampered with), take their keys from physical processes, and have been validated, socio-technical protocols can ensure that it is infeasible to forge the identity of a hardware security module in a cubesat with another cubesat. If, however, some cubesats are destroyed, the blockchain will continue to execute correctly though some transactions will be lost.

The system generates an address/account allocation for each account that indicates addresses that have sufficient cryptocurrency to cover the account balance of the account. The system then generates a Merkle tree with leaf nodes for each account that includes the hash of the address/account allocation for the account. The system records a transaction in the blockchain that includes the root hash of the Merkle tree as evidence of the address/account allocation for an account. An account owner can use a purported address/account allocation to regenerate the root hash. If the regenerated root hash matches the root hash recorded in the blockchain, then the account owner has confirmed that the purported address/account allocation is the actual address/account allocation for the account. ;US;Jersey;A;KY;Kaimaninseln

Compartmentalizing canonicality and validity and keeping overall functionality to a minimum of security and transport introduces practical core extensibility in situ.

Filling the gap, the current interest-bearing debt system has shifted risk in an unsustainable manner that stands in contrast to a profit-loss-sharing arrangement. The International Currency Unit (ICU) platform promotes a recoupling of the financial sector with the real sector by providing a more stable risk distribution between parties. In particular, each ICU is generated based on an index, which is based on current values of each of a plurality of real-world currencies. The plurality of real-world currencies may be selected for inclusion in the index based on relative value stability, widespread global acceptance, or any other criteria. As the ICU is tied to current values of a stable set of real-world currencies, fluctuations in the value of the ICU are minimized, which promotes international contract formation. ;US;Jersey;A;US;USA

When a verification result indicates that the target transaction is valid, the method proceeds to performing the second and third processes. The second process includes transferring electronic currency from an electronic wallet of the payer to an electronic wallet of the payee. The third process includes recording data for the target transaction in a new block, and spreading the new block over the blockchain network. In some embodiments, the second process and the third process are performed in parallel. ;US;Jersey;B;KR;Südkorea

Additionally, the enclosure is designed to maintain the cryptocurrency mining rig within a desired thermal profile. To achieve this, the enclosure has a housing with a rig receptacle, a pair of ventilating lids an external vent and an access port. The ventilating lids are mounted over an opening of the rig receptacle and positioned offset from each other. This enables airflow into the rig receptacle while creating a circuitous path along which noise must travel when exiting the rig receptacle. Similarly, the external vent is a circuitous duct that extends through the housing. This enables air to flow into the housing without compromising the noise-reducing properties of the enclosure. The access port extends through the housing and enables the enclosure to be connected to external systems. ;US;Jersey;B;US;USA
